# DNAHydrogelNeuralCellularAutomata
## This repository will hold all relevant simulations for creating DNA-functionalized hydrogel based Neural Cellular Automata.

* Simple starting points include: discrete and continuous cellular automata based on Lenia: https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html
* Neural Cellular Automata will be developed following methodology based on work on growing NCAs: https://distill.pub/2020/growing-ca/
